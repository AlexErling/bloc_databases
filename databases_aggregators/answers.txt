3. I would determine the display order by looking at the data, and then determining whether it was ordered by asc (the default) or desc order.

4. You can use it when you are finding very specific data. For example say you own a store where you sell 20 items and you want to know the 5 most expensive. You can order the items in a list, offset the first 15 you aren't interested in and put a limit to show the other 5.

5. It is important to use ORDER BY so you can organize your data, so you can actually effectively use the LIMIT to the data you want to see.

6. While the WHERE clause filters individual rows by a given condition, the  HAVING clause eliminates entire groups of results with a single comparison. WHERE filters rows before aggregation (GROUP BY); HAVING filters groups after aggregations are performed.


7. SELECT id, SUM (amount)
FROM payment
WHERE SUM (amount) > 200;
